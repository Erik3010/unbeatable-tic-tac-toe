# Unbeatable Tic Tac Toe

This is a simple unbeatable Tic Tac Toe game written in Javascript. The game uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best possible move for the bot. The bot will never lose, but the game can end in a draw.

## How to play

Click on the squares to make your move. The bot will automatically make its move after you. The game will end when either you or the bot wins, or when the game ends in a draw.
